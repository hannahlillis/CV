## Hannah Lillis

A full stack web development student at Makers Academy, with a background in mathematics and previous experience in education, analytics and digital marketing.

I particularly enjoy working out and developing the back-end logic needed to solve a particular problem, following the principles of TDD. My ideal developer role would allow me to do this in a company I feel passionately about, while at the same time allowing me to continue learning and broadening my skills as a developer.

## Skills

#### Analytical

As an Analyst in the Travelex digital marketing team, I have developed my analytical skills and the way in which I tackle tasks. I am able to approach problems methodically, breaking them down and planning each step. This has been invaluable for me when learning to code, as it allows me to carefully think through the requirements of a problem, and approach each challenge in a logical, thought-out way.

My previous Analyst roles have also allowed me to develop a business-focused mindset. I believe this experience will allow me to be a greater asset to any team I join as I will be able to appreciate the wider business objectives as well as those of the developers.  

#### Communication

In all my previous roles, communication has played an important part. As an Assistant Director of a tuition centre, it was vital that I communicated well when helping the children, holding consultations with the parents, or training and managing the tutors. My experience in tutoring has greatly helped me when pair programming as I am able to clearly explain what I'm doing at any point.

In my roles in digital marketing, I have had plenty of experience in showcasing projects to the wider business, both in written reports, and presentations. I am looking forward to being able to continue doing this, but this time, in a technical capacity.

#### Eye for detail

As a CRM Manager, I was responsible for Travelex's email marketing which was regularly sent to over a million subscribed customers. It was crucial that each email being sent was carefully built, tested and checked, along with the segment of customers who would receive it. I developed a keen eye for detail in this position which has helped me a great deal when writing code. My meticulousness means I am usually able to spot any typos or minor mistakes in the code, and eliminate these errors as quickly as possible so they don't cause any issues down the line.

## Projects

During my time at Makers, I have worked on many projects, both independently and in pairs/teams. The below projects are the ones of which I'm most proud, and I believe they showcase well the progress I have made since starting at Makers.
